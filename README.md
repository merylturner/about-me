# How to Use
This site is my intro project in Code 201. I developed a guessing game with javascript for the user to answer some questions about me. At the end of the game, they get to see how many answers they got right. 

The webpage has some information about me, Meryl Turner - it gives the answers to the guessing game, and then goes on to talk about my Interests, Education and Skills. I have also given a link to my online portfolio in the navigation header.
